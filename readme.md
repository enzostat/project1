Thank you for playing my game. 

There are 3 modes. Easy Normal and Hard.

With the easy mode, you get 6 clues: 2 suspects, 2 rooms and 2 weapons. You also get 15 turns.
With the normal mode, you get 4 clues: 2 suspects, 1 room and 1 weapon. You get 10 turns. 
On the hard mode, you get no clues and 15 turns. 

At the bottom of the screen, you will find radio buttons. You can use these to keep track of the clues you are given. Each turn will give you the option to move to an adjoining room and make a suggestion. Your suggestion consists of the room you are in and a weapon and suspect of your choice. During the suggestion phase, you can also make an accusation. Please note, you only have once chance to make an accusation. If you are wrong, you will lose the game. 

During the movement phase, you are allowed to stay in the room you are currently in.
